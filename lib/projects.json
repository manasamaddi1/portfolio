        "description": "I examined national power outage statistics for this initiative and applied regression models to forecast how long outages will continue depending on environmental and infrastructure elements including storm type, area, and utility company. I gathered data from FEMA, NOAA, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration, cleaned and combined the databases, and ran statistical tests to confirm theories. Using Python tools such as Seaborn and Plotly, I also displayed important results, which helped to highlight geographical differences and trends over time."

        "description": "Based on a user's mood or lyric preferences, I built a fun and tailored recommendation tool that recommends Taylor Swift songs. Using the Spotify API, I collected audio characteristics including tempo, energy, and danceability; I also included the Genius API so users could look up lyrics. To hone the suggestions, I used mood-based filters and cosine similarity. The project not only showed me how to use outside APIs but also provided me with knowledge creating algorithms linking human preferences with data. It was a fantastic opportunity to combine technical skills with imagination."

        "description": "Mapping environmental risk indices—such as air pollution, water quality, and health inequalities—across San Diego census tracts was my responsibility in this research. Starting with environmental and public health data, I used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to lower dimensionality while maintaining significant patterns across variables. To show local level differences, I created interactive maps using OpenStreetMap and Leaflet among other mapping tools."

        "description": "Using NASA's meteorite landing information, I investigated worldwide patterns in meteorite strikes. I filtered and cleaned the data using Pandas, then produced an interactive map showing the meteorite geographic distribution using Folium. I also used statistical analysis to search for patterns connected to meteorite mass, fall type (observed vs. found), and year. This project made me value how data may expose concealed patterns in natural events and showed me how to use mapping tools and data science to make interesting stories by means of visualization."

        "description": "Working with a student team, I examined in-app activity data and survey results for After Hours, a productivity tool created for college students. I created visualizations to present our results to the development team, helped to locate important engagement drop-offs, and suggested feature changes to boost retention. The analysis guided a redesign of the app's onboarding process and helped to build the marketing plan. Working with actual user data to create a digital product more user-friendly and efficient was a worthwhile hands-on experience."

From worldwide sources including the IMF and World Bank, we collected data, cleaned it, and created time series models applying ARIMA and exponential smoothing techniques. Dashboards helped me to see trends and contrast model performance. Predictive modeling, teamwork, and simplifying economic data for a larger audience were all areas in which this initiative enhanced my abilities."
