    Hi! I’m Manasa Maddi, a Data Science major at UC San Diego passionate about using technology to make a real-world impact. 
        From building AI-driven waste sorters to analyzing global power outages and designing STEM education programs for underserved students, 
        I love solving problems that blend data, creativity, and purpose. I have co-founded a nonprofit, led robotics outreach to over 500 students, 
        and published a crash course thats helped thousands learn robotics and programming. I'm currently diving deeper into predictive analytics, 
        machine learning, and HCI research—and I'm always excited to collaborate on meaningful, people-centered projects.
